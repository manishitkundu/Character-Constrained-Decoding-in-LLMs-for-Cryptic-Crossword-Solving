# Character-Constrained Decoding in LLMs for Cryptic Crossword Solving
A GitHub repo for character-constrained decoding in LLMs applied to cryptic crossword solving. Includes a 161K+ clue dataset, evaluation of LLMs’ failure to follow answer length constraints, and a character-level decoding strategy that boosts few-shot accuracy 3× without additional fine-tuning.
